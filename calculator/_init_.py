'''

This Python code defines a Calculator class that provides a simple interface for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on Decimal numbers. The class uses static methods, demonstrating a functional approach within an object-oriented context. 
Each operation method creates a Calculation object, performs the calculation, adds it to a history of calculations, and then returns the result. 
Let's break down the code with detailed comments and highlight its design principles.

Design Principles Illustrated
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The Calculator class is focused solely on performing calculations using the provided operations. It delegates the responsibility of managing calculation history to the Calculations class, adhering to SRP by having a single reason to change.

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): The _perform_operation method abstracts the common process of creating a calculation, adding it to the history, and returning the result. This reduces repetition in the operation methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide), each of which only specifies the operation to perform.

Separation of Concerns: The Calculator class separates concerns by handling the calculation logic, while the Calculations class manages the history of calculations. This separation ensures that each class has a distinct responsibility, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

Encapsulation: While not encapsulating in the traditional sense of hiding data within an object, the Calculator class encapsulates the behavior of performing calculations and managing their lifecycle, showcasing functional encapsulation.

Polymorphism: The use of a Callable type hint for the operation parameter in _perform_operation method demonstrates polymorphism. It allows for any function that matches the specified signature to be passed in and executed, showcasing flexibility and reuse.

This code demonstrates effective use of object-oriented and functional programming principles to create a modular, maintainable, and easy-to-use calculator interface.
