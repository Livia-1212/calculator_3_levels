"""
This module contains tests for the calculator operations and Calculation class.

The tests are designed to verify the correctness of basic arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) implemented in the calculator.operations module,
as well as the functionality of the Calculation class that encapsulates these operations.
"""

# Import statements:
# Disable specific pylint warnings that are not relevant for this test file.
# Import the Decimal class for precise decimal arithmetic, which is especially useful in financial calculations.
# Import pytest for writing test cases.
# Import the Calculation class from the calculator package to test its functionality.
# Import the arithmetic operation functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to be tested.
# pylint: disable=unnecessary-dunder-call, invalid-name

# pytest.mark.parametrize decorator is used to parameterize a test function, enabling it to be called
# with different sets of arguments. Here, it's used to test various scenarios of arithmetic operations
# with both integer and decimal operands to ensure the operations work correctly under different conditions.

    Test calculation operations with various scenarios.
    
    This test ensures that the Calculation class correctly performs the arithmetic operation

    Parameters:
        a (Decimal): The first operand in the calculation.
        b (Decimal): The second operand in the calculation.
